I didn't know how to use selenium so I tryed to use Python to crate that automation program.

First 3 line - Are for importing selenium and Keys(enter, esc, click etc.).

5 and 6 lines - Are me locating the file path in my computer.

8 and 9 lines - Are going to the webpage named "https://www.playtech.ee".

11 and 12 lines - I tryed to locate "Internship" button (i tryed to find by using f11 console to locate id,name or class) i used name.

14 to 21 lines - Is me trying to get text file for verification that if the “Development QA Engineer (Intern)” position is shown on the page.

line 24 quits.


I know that isn't the right answer to the test assignment. But i tried hard to understand and i was learning new thing like, what is selenium and, what is selenium used for.
